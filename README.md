“My background is putting in large systems that change lives... 
                        The right kind of systems can bring honesty and efficiency”

I am a starting junior software engineer located in North-West Arkansas. I spent five years in the U.S. Army as a Human Intelligence Collector and have worked for the U.S. Federal Government for a decade. I am working towards developing my skills as a software engineer. I have a passion for creativity and problem solving which directly impact my work. I am excited to grow my technical skills in the field of Software Engineering and Development. I am currently enrolling in the Thinkful bootcamp. I have also completed a course in Python and am currently taking a course in databases. Efficiency is a principle I hold dearly, and I agree with Nandan Nilekani that, “the right kind of systems can bring honesty and efficiency.” I look forward to working together soon, developing a system with these principles in mind.
